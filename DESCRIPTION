Description: The "kbal" package provides a weighting approach that employs kernels to make one group have a similar distribution to another group on covariates, not only in terms of means or marginal distributions, but also on higher order transformations implied by the choice of kernel. The package is applicable to both treatment effect estimation and survey reweighting problems. Based on  Hazlett, C. (2020) "Kernel Balancing: A flexible non-parametric weighting procedure for estimating causal effects." Statistica Sinica. <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299013953_Kernel_Balancing_A_flexible_non-parametric_weighting_procedure_for_estimating_causal_effects/stats>.
