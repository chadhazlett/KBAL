Description: A weighting approach the employs kernels to make one group
    have similar distribution as another on covariates, 
    not just but on higher order transformations implied 
    by the choice of kernel. This applies to both treatment 
    effect estimation and to survey reweighting problems. 
    Based on  Hazlett, C. (2020) "Kernel Balancing: A flexible 
    non-parametric weighting procedure 
    for estimating causal effects." Statistica Sinica.
