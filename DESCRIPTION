Description: Provides a weighting approach that employs kernels to make one group have a similar distribution to another group on covariates. This method matches not only means or marginal distributions but also higher-order transformations implied by the choice of kernel. 'kbal' is applicable to both treatment effect estimation and survey reweighting problems. Based on Hazlett, C. (2020) "Kernel Balancing: A flexible non-parametric weighting procedure for estimating causal effects." Statistica Sinica. <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299013953_Kernel_Balancing_A_flexible_non-parametric_weighting_procedure_for_estimating_causal_effects>.
